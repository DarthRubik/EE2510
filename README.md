This is going to be my repository for all of my code for EE2510

I plan on having each labs "main" file in a seperate folder with all of its specific code there.  If I have code that is going to be used in multiple labs I am going to try to put it in a seperate folder.....I think I am going to use c++14 for this project at the moment but we will see....
